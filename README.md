# UnbanBot
A stupid bot made quickly to wipe the Read the docs discord server ban list

## How to use
Use [luvit](https://github.com/luvit/luvit). Just do the following command: `luvit bot` in the git repository

You need to be administrator of the guild. You can wipe the banlist like this: `@Bot unban-all` where @Bot is the bot mention.
